# Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing U.S. hospital quality and performance data using Power BI.
The objective is to evaluate hospital performance across different quality measures, patient experience scores, and state-wise trends to identify patterns and improvement opportunities in healthcare services.

# Dataset Description

The dataset contains U.S. hospital-level information including:
- Hospital name and location
- State-wise hospital distribution
- Quality of care metrics
- Patient experience indicators
- Performance measures across different healthcare domains

Source: Publicly available U.S. healthcare data.

# Tools & Technologies Used

- Power BI – Data modeling, DAX measures, and interactive dashboards
- Microsoft Excel / CSV – Dataset storage and preprocessing
- GitHub – Project version control and documentation

# Overall Hospital Performance Insights
## Hospital Coverage & Infrastructure

The dataset includes 4,812 hospitals across the U.S., providing strong nationwide coverage.

Acute Care Hospitals dominate (~70%), forming the backbone of the U.S. healthcare system.

4,497 hospitals offer emergency services, indicating that over 90% of hospitals are emergency-ready, with only a small portion lacking emergency facilities.

Insight:
The U.S. healthcare infrastructure is heavily centered around acute care with strong emergency preparedness nationwide.

## Quality Ratings & Safety Performance

The average hospital rating is 2.27, indicating moderate overall performance.

Hospitals with higher safety scores consistently show higher overall ratings, while low-rated hospitals are strongly associated with poor safety scores.

Insight:
Safety performance is a key driver of hospital ratings, making it a critical focus area for quality improvement initiatives.

## Timely & Effective Care

The average timely care score is 1.51, which is relatively low.

While many hospitals perform at or above the national average, 900+ hospitals still fall below the national benchmark for timely care.

Insight:
Delays in care remain a widespread issue, suggesting inefficiencies in patient flow, staffing, or operational processes.

## Patient Satisfaction

Patient experience scores are generally better than timely care scores.

Most hospitals fall in the Same As or Above National Average category for patient satisfaction.

Insight:
Patients report better experiences than operational performance suggests, indicating that service quality may compensate for delays in some hospitals.

## Readmission Rates

Readmission rates are consistently high nationwide.

A large number of hospitals fall Same As or Above the National Readmission Average, highlighting systemic discharge and follow-up challenges.

Insight:
High readmission rates point to gaps in post-discharge care, care coordination, and long-term patient monitoring.

# State-Level Performance Insights
## Top & Low Performing States

New Hampshire (NH) is the top-performing state with an average rating of 3.35, indicating strong healthcare quality.

Northern Mariana Islands (MP) shows the lowest rating (0), likely due to missing or limited hospital performance data.

Insight:
Healthcare quality varies significantly by geography, with some regions excelling while others lag or lack sufficient data.

## State-wise Hospital Distribution

Texas (TX) has the highest number of hospitals (411), followed by California (CA).

These states also have the highest number of emergency hospitals, reflecting large and dense healthcare networks.

Insight:
Large states have well-distributed healthcare infrastructure, but scale alone does not guarantee higher performance ratings.

## Timely Care & Patient Experience by State

Wisconsin (WI) and Minnesota (MN) show top timely care scores, indicating faster and more effective treatment.

Maine (ME) and Vermont (VT) lead in patient experience scores, showing strong patient-centered care.

Insight:
Operational efficiency and patient satisfaction excellence are not always found in the same states, highlighting different healthcare strengths.

## Ownership Trends

Voluntary Non-Profit Hospitals form the largest ownership group.

These hospitals also tend to show slightly higher average ratings compared to government and proprietary hospitals.

Insight:
Non-profit hospitals may benefit from patient-centric policies and reinvestment in quality improvements.

 # Conclusions:

The U.S. healthcare system has strong infrastructure and emergency readiness, but quality and efficiency vary widely.

Safety and timely care are the most influential factors impacting hospital ratings.

Patient satisfaction is relatively strong, but readmission rates remain a major concern.

State-level disparities highlight the need for targeted policy and operational improvements.

Non-profit hospitals generally outperform others in quality-related metrics.
